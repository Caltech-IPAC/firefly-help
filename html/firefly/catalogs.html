<h2>Firefly: Catalogs</h2>

<h3><a name="catalogs">Catalogs</A></h3>

Catalogs are a special case of <a href="tables.html">tables</A>; the
basic functionality of tables is covered in the <a
href="tables.html">Tables section</A>.  You can load a wide variety of
catalogs to load for overlaying on your <a
href="visualization.html">visualized data</A>. If you don't have an <a
href="images.html">image</A> loaded, the tool will pick a "coverage
image" for you and overlay the catalog on that image. It will also <a
href="plots.html">make a plot for you</A>, which you can change. <P>

<h3><a name="intro">Introduction</A></h3>

There are several different ways to get catalogs into Firefly.
This chapter focuses on IRSA catalogs. <P>

<img src="img/catalogsintro.png"> When you click on the "Catalogs" tab
at the top of the Firefly window, you are dropped into an IRSA
Catalogs search, which is what we describe here. There are <a
href="othersearches.html">other kinds of searches</A> you can also do
that will load catalogs (or other tables) into the tool. <P>


<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="irsacatalogs"><a name="catalogs">IRSA Catalogs</A></A> --
Searching for catalogs at IRSA</h3>

<img src="img/catalogsearch.png" width="100%" style="border:3px solid gray"><P>

The upper left quadrant of this window is where you specify which
catalog you want to search.  To change catalogs, first select the
"project" under which they are housed at IRSA, such as 2MASS, IRAS,
WISE, MSX, etc.  The available choices underneath that change
according to the project you have selected.  A short description is
provided for each of the catalogs, with links for more information
(including definitions of the sometimes cryptic column names); an
example is here:<br> <img src="img/catalogcoldef.png"><P>

The upper right quadrant of this window is where you specify the
target (the position is sometimes pre-filled with its best guess as to
what you want) and the search method (cone, elliptical, box, polygon,
multi-object, all-sky), and the parameters that go with that search
method (e.g., the radius of the cone). The parameters for each of
these searches change dynamically as you select search options, as
follows:  <P>

<DL>
<DT><strong>Caution</strong>: <DD>Pick your units from the drop-down
first, and then enter a number; if you enter a number and then select
from the drop-down, it will convert your number from the old units to
the new units. There are both upper and lower limits to your search
radius; it will tell you if you request something too big or too
small. Note that these limits are catalog-dependent.   <P>

<DT><strong>Cone search</strong>: <dd> <img
src="img/catsearch-cone.png" style="border:3px solid gray"> <br>
You can put in a position, but sometimes it attempts to guess a
position, based on prior searches. You specify the cone radius; the
default is 10 arcsec.<P>

<DT><strong>Elliptical search</strong>: <dd> <img
src="img/catsearch-ellip.png" style="border:3px solid gray"> <br>
You can put in a position, but sometimes it attempts to guess a
position, based on prior searches. You specify the search ellipse's
semi-major axis, position ratio, and axial ratio. Defaults are as
shown.<P>

<DT><strong>Box search</strong>: <dd> <img
src="img/catsearch-box.png" style="border:3px solid gray"> <br>
You can put in a position, but sometimes it attempts to guess a
position, based on prior searches. You specify the box's length on a
side; default is as shown.<P>

<DT><strong>Polygon search</strong>: 
<dd> <img
src="img/catsearch-polygon.png" style="border:3px solid gray"> <img
src="img/catsearch-polygon2.png" style="border:3px solid gray"> <br>
For this, note that it no longer has a single target location. It will
sometimes try to pre-fill the vertices of the position it thinks you want, based on
prior searches. If you have images loaded, it will give you choices
based on the current image -- you can select whether you want
the catalog request to match the entire area of the image you have
selected ("image"), or just the portion of the image you can see in
the current view ("visible"), or your own ("custom") area. (However,
note that if you have selected a HiPS image before searching, you are
limited to a maximum of 5 degrees.) The list of
vertices in the coordinates box are in decimal RA and Dec in degrees.
You must enter at least 3 and at most 15 vertices, separated by a
comma. Note that, for overlaying catalogs on HiPS images, you cannot
select "image", because HiPS images are generally very, very large, so
this would result in too many points being returned. There is a
maximum of 5 degrees imposed on catalog searches to match HiPS
images.<P>
If you <a href="visualization.html#selectregion">select a 
rectangular region</A> of your image and then select a polygon
catalog search, you will have a fourth radio button above, "selection",
which matches the corners of your selected image region.<P>
If you select the "bullseye" icon on the right (<img
src="img/clicktosearch.png">), you get a pop-up with
a way to interactively select your target; this works just like <a
href="othersearches.html#interactivetarget">this interactive target
refinement</A> (go there for more details) :<br>
<img src="img/choosetarget.png" width="300" style="border:3px solid gray"><P>

<DT><strong>Multi-Object search</strong>: <dd> <img
src="img/catsearch-multiobj.png" style="border:3px solid gray"><br> 
For a multi-object search, it can't guess what position you want.
You need to upload a file (from your disk or the <a href="/docs/workspace/"
target="_blank">IRSA Workspace <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></A>) in <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/DDGEN/Doc/ipac_tbl.html"
target="_blank">IPAC table format <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></A>, which is a varietal of plain text. (IRSA has a <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/TblValidator/"
target="_blank">table validator <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></A> which may be helpful.) Note that you also have to
specify the radius over which to search for each of the targets in
your list.<P>

When you do a multi-position search on catalogs, three new columns are
added to the catalog as it is returned to you. These columns are :
<UL>
<LI>cntr_01 - the target position you requested
<LI>dist_x - the distance between the target position you requested
and the object it found
<LI>pang_x - the position angle between the target position you requested
and the object it found
</UL>
These additional columns can help you assess if the target(s) it found is
the target that should be matched to the position you requested.<P>


<DT><strong>All-sky search</strong>: <dd> <img
src="img/catsearch-allsky.png" style="border:3px solid gray"><br> 
Because this is an all-sky search, it does not have a single target
entry box. In order to constrain this search, you need to impose
constraints on the bottom of the screen (see below). <P>

</dl>

The bottom of this window allows you to set restrictions on specific
columns. It gives you a list of all the available column names in the
corresponding catalog. (Most catalogs have identical "standard" and
"long form" selections, but some have more columns available in "long
form".) From here, you can choose what to display (tickboxes on the
left), and filter what is returned ("constraints" column). For
example, only return objects with values in column y that are greater
than x. If you add more than one restriction, they are combined
logically using an "AND" operators; be careful, because you can thus
restrict data such that none of the catalog meets your criteria.<P>

Click on "Search" to initiate the search. It will load the catalog
into a tab of its own. The objects will also be overlaid on any images
you have loaded, and a default x-y plot will be shown. (For more on the
x-y plots, see <a href="plots.html">Plots section</A>.)  All of these
representations are interlinked -- clicking on a row in the table
shows it on the image and in the plot, and clicking on an object in
the image shows it in the table and in the plot, and clicking on an
object in the plot shows it in the table and on the image.<P>

To close the catalog search window without searching for a catalog,
click on "Cancel".<P>

<strong><font color="orange">&#x26A0;</font>  Tips and Troubleshooting</strong> 
<UL>
<LI>If the catalog search is successful quickly, it will promptly return
the results in a tab of its own. 

<LI>The search may take a long time to return, especially
if you have asked for a large catalog, and you may think that nothing
has happened, but be patient and eventually it will 
return a tab.

<LI>Use large search radii with caution! Be sure you understand how many
sources you are likely to retrieve. Searches that retrieve more rows
will take longer. Searches that retrieve tens of thousands of rows
will take quite a while. 

<LI>If you want to impose additional constraints on the catalog during
your initial search, you can do so in the lower half of the screen
(e.g., SNR &gt; n in some band, or an SQL command), you can place
constraints at this point. However, be advised that it is easy to
combine constraints such that no sources are retrieved!

<LI> If you overlay a large catalog, large enough that the <a
href="plots.html">plot is a binned heatmap</A>, <strong>the entire
source list is NOT overlaid, even if you zoom in a lot</strong>. The
way to work within these constraints is to impose a filter on the
catalog to get it below the threshold for a regular plot -- weed out
lower SNR sources, or filter based on RA/Dec, etc. Then all the
individual sources will be shown.

<LI> If you overlay a large catalog, then turn around and <a
href="visualization.html#fitsDownloadOptions">save a regions file from
the catalog overlay</A>, then unusual things can happen. If the plot
that results from the catalog is small enough to show individual
points in the plot, then all of the overlays will be saved to the
regions file. BUT if you have a <a href="plots.html">plot with enough
points that it is a binned heatmap</A>, the greatly abbreviated
("decimated") source list overlay will be saved, <strong>NOT</strong>
the entire catalog!

<LI>If you have "pan by table row" turned on (see <a
href="visualization.html#panbytablerow">Visualization chapter</A>),
then it may be disconcerting to have the images "jump" right after the
catalog loads. It is centering the selected catalog object (the first
one upon catalog loading) in the viewer. If you don't like this, turn
off "pan by table row".

<LI>By default, it may show you fewer columns than are available in
the full catalog. By selecting "long form" (above the list of
columns), you can access the full range of available columns. In some
cases, there are literally hundreds of columns that you can access!

<LI>If you start searching from a HiPS image, you are limited to a 5
degree search radius.

</ul><P>

The search results are then shown in a <a href="tables.html">Firefly
table</A> and you can <a href="#interacting">interact with it</A>.<P>



<hr width="50%">
<h3><A name="interacting">Interacting with Catalogs</A></h3>

When you load a catalog, the tool may create a table, a plot, and/or,
if your catalog has position information (e.g., RA and dec), it
overlays the catalog on an image. All three of these ways of
displaying the catalog are interlinked and interactive.<P>

Catalogs are a special case of <a href="tables.html">tables</A>; the
basic functionality of tables is covered in the <a
href="tables.html">Tables section</A>. You can sort and filter the
table.<P>

<A href="plots.html">Plots</A> are also covered in a different
section. You can make scatter plots, heat maps, and histograms. You
can plot columns from your catalog, including simple mathematical
manipulations of catalog columns.<P>

If the catalog has positions included, the catalog will also be
overlaid on the loaded image(s). The <a
href="visualization.html">Visualization section</A> includes
information about that. Each catalog that you load is overlaid on the
image using different, customizable symbols and colors. <P>

<strong><font color="orange">&#x26A0;</font> Tips and Troubleshooting</strong> 
<UL>
<LI>Note that if you overlay a large catalog <a
href="visualization.html">on an image</A>, the <strong>full contents
of the catalog may not be displayed in the overlay</strong>. Catalog
overlays on images are statistically "thinned" to avoid overcrowding
the display. This occurs when the number of catalog entries in an
overlay exceeds 5,000. Currently, this thinning is not reversed even
when zooming in to the image. However, if you select a catalog entry
from its table, or from a point in an associated chart, the
corresponding point in the image display overlay will be displayed
even if that entry was originally "thinned out." Also, geometric
selections on an image (using the rectangle or circle tools) will
still select all the catalog entries in the selection region, even
ones that have been "thinned out", or "decimated."

<LI>Because of the prior item, if you save the overlays from an image
as a regions file. If you initiate that save from the image toobar,
catalogs that have  been "thinned out" will not appear in their
entirety in the resulting regions file. However, you can save the full
contents of a single catalog as a regions file using the "save"
(diskette) icon in the table toolbar, instead of the image toobar. 
</UL>

<P>



<hr width="50%">
<h3><A name="details">Details Tab</A></h3>

If you load a catalog from IRSA, you will likely have an additional
tab on the right hand side, under the plot, called "Details." This
additional tab is sometimes called a "property sheet." This tab is,
itself, another <a href="tables.html">Firefly table</A>, and consists
of each of the columns of the retrieved catalog with additional
information about each field where available. (Not every catalog may
have this information available.) This information can be used to
learn more about each of the columns in retrieved. For additional
information, please consult the full documentation that accompanies
the catalog. <P>


<strong><font color="orange">&#x26A0;</font> Tips and Troubleshooting</strong>
<UL>
<LI>The property sheet is a more expanded, vertical view of the
information shown in a row of a catalog, along with documentation of
the catalog columns. Because you can sort/filter the data in the
property sheet, you can restrict what values are shown. Those filters
are respected as you page through a catalog. So, for example (see
screenshot below), you can pull up the property sheet, filter it down
to only show the profile-fitted magnitudes and errors by filtering on
"mpro", and then step through the values in the catalog and inspecting
the brightnesses as shown in the property sheet for each source. 
<LI>When changing rows in the main table, the property sheet/details
tab scrolls to preserve the visibility of whatever row in the details
tab is highlighted. If you scroll down in the property sheet
<em>without changing the highlight</em>, when you change rows in the
main table, because the first row in any table is always highlighted
by default, the property sheet will scroll back to the top.
