<h2>Firefly: Catalogs</h2>

<h3><a name="catalogs">Catalogs</A></h3>

Catalogs are a special case of <a href="tables.html">tables</A>; the
basic functionality of tables is covered in the <a
href="tables.html">Tables section</A>.  You can choose from any of a
wide variety of catalogs to load for overlaying on your <a
href="visualization.html">visualized data</A>. If you don't have an
image loaded, and you search on a catalog, the tool will pick an image
for you and overlay the catalog on that image. Once you've loaded a
catalog, you can <a href="plots.html">make plots</A>. <P>

<h3><a name="irsacatalogs"><a name="catalogs">IRSA Catalogs</A></A> -- Searching for catalogs from IRSA</h3>

By clicking on the blue "Catalog" tab (which also looks like a
button), a window appears with several options, as follows. By
default, it starts with the IRSA Catalog Search.  <P>

<img src="img/catalogsearch.png" width="100%"><P>

The upper left quadrant of this window is where you specify which
catalog you want to search.  To change catalogs, first select the
"project" under which they are housed at IRSA, such as 2MASS, IRAS,
WISE, MSX, etc.  The available choices underneath that change
according to the project you have selected.  A short description is
provided for each of the catalogs, with links for more information
(including definitions of the sometimes cryptic column names); an
example is here:<br> <img src="img/catalogcoldef.png"><P>

The upper right quadrant of this window is where you specify the
target (the position can be pre-filled with its best guess as to what
you want) and the search method (cone, elliptical, box, polygon,
multi-object, all-sky), and the parameters that go with that search
method (e.g., the radius of the cone). The parameters for each of
these searches change dynamically as you select search options, as
follows:  <P>

<DL>
<DT><strong>Caution</strong>: <DD>Pick your units from the pulldown
first, and then enter a number; if you enter a number and then select
from the pulldown, it will convert your number from the old units to
the new units. There are both upper and lower limits to your search
radius; it will tell you if you request something too big or too
small. Note that these limits are catalog-dependent.   <P>

<DT><strong>Cone search</strong>: <dd> <img
src="img/catsearch-cone.png"> <br>
In this example, it has guessed a position, based on prior searches.
You specify the cone radius.<P>

<DT><strong>Elliptical search</strong>: <dd> <img
src="img/catsearch-ellip.png"> <br>
In this example, it has guessed a position, based on prior searches.
You specify the search ellipse's semi-major axis, position ratio, and
axial ratio.<P>

<DT><strong>Box search</strong>: <dd> <img
src="img/catsearch-box.png"> <br>
In this example, it has guessed a position, based on prior searches.
You specify the box's length on a side.<P>

<DT><strong>Polygon search</strong>: <dd> <img
src="img/catsearch-polygon.png"> <br>
Now, note that it no longer has a single target location. It has
pre-filled the vertices of the position it thinks you want, based on
prior searches or the current image.  You can select whether you want
the catalog request to match the entire area of the image you have
selected ("image"), or just the portion of the image you can see in
the current view ("visible"), or your own ("custom") area. The list of
vertices in the coordinates box are in decimal RA and Dec in degrees.
You must enter at least 3 and at most 15 vertices, separated by a
comma. Note that, for overlaying catalogs on HiPS images, you cannot
select "image", because HiPS images are generally very, very large, so
this would result in too many points being returned. There is a
maximum of 5 degrees imposed on catalog searches to match HiPS
images.<P>
If you <a href="visualization.html#selectregion">select a 
rectangular region</A> of your image (if relevant) and then select a polygon
catalog search, you will have a fourth radio button above, "selection",
which matches the corners of your selected image region.<P>


<DT><strong>Multi-Object search</strong>: <dd> <img
src="img/catsearch-multiobj.png"><br> 
In this case, it has not attempted to guess what position you want.
You need to upload a file (from your disk or the <a href="/docs/workspace/"
target="_blank">IRSA Workspace <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></A>) in <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/DDGEN/Doc/ipac_tbl.html"
target="_blank">IPAC table format <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></A>, which is a varietal of plain text. (IRSA has a <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/TblValidator/"
target="_blank">table validator <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></A> which may be helpful.) Note that you also have to
specify the radius over which to search for each of the targets in
your list.<P>

When you do a multi-position search on catalogs, three new columns are
added to the catalog as it is returned to you. These columns are :
<UL>
<LI>cntr_01 - the target position you requested
<LI>dist_x - the distance between the target position you requested
and the object it found
<LI>pang_x - the position angle between the target position you requested
and the object it found
</UL>
These additional columns can help you assess if the target(s) it found is
the target that should be matched to the position you requested.<P>


<DT><strong>All-sky search</strong>: <dd> <img
src="img/catsearch-allsky.png"><br> 
Because this is an all-sky search, it does not have a single target
entry box. In order to constrain this search, you need to impose
constraints on the bottom of the screen (see below). <P>

</dl>

The bottom of this window allows you to set restrictions on specific
columns. It gives you a list of all the available column names in the
corresponding catalog. (Most catalogs have identical "standard" and
"long form" selections, but some have more columns available in "long
form".) From here, you can choose what to display (tickboxes on the
left), and filter what is returned ("constraints" column). For
example, only return objects with values in column y that are greater
than x. If you add more than one restriction, they are combined
logically using an "AND" operators; be careful, because you can thus
restrict data such that none of the catalog meets your criteria.<P>

Click on "Search" to initiate the search. It will load the catalog
into a tab of its own. The objects will also be overlaid on any images
you have loaded, and a default x-y plot will be shown. (For more on the
x-y plots, see <a href="plots.html">Plots section</A>.)  All of these
representations are interlinked -- clicking on a row in the table
shows it on the image and in the plot, and clicking on an object in
the image shows it in the table and in the plot, and clicking on an
object in the plot shows it in the table and on the image.<P>

To close the catalog search window without searching for a catalog,
click on "Cancel".<P>

<strong>Tips and Troubleshooting</strong> 
<UL>
<LI>If the catalog search is successful quickly, it will promptly return
the results in a tab of its own. 

<LI>The search may take a long time to return, especially
if you have asked for a large catalog, and you may think that nothing
has happened, but be patient and eventually it will 
return a tab.

<LI>Use large search radii with caution! Be sure you understand how many
sources you are likely to retrieve. Searches that retrieve more rows
will take longer. Searches that retrieve tens of thousands of rows
will take quite a while. 

<LI>If you want to impose additional constraints on the catalog during
your initial search, you can do so in the lower half of the screen
(e.g., SNR &gt; n in some band, or an SQL command), you can place
constraints at this point. However, be advised that it is easy to
combine constraints such that no sources are retrieved!

<LI> If you overlay a large catalog, large enough that the <a
href="plots.html">plot is a binned heatmap</A>, <strong>the entire
source list is NOT overlaid, even if you zoom in a lot</strong>. The
way to work within these constraints is to impose a filter on the
catalog to get it below the threshhold for a regular plot -- weed out
lower SNR sources, or filter based on RA/Dec, etc. Then all the
individual sources will be shown.

<LI> If you overlay a large catalog, then turn around and <a
href="visualization.html#fitsDownloadOptions">save a regions file from
the catalog overlay</A>, then unusual things can happen. If the plot
that results from the catalog is small enough to show individual
points in the plot, then all of the overlays will be saved to the
regions file. BUT if you have a <a href="plots.html">plot with enough
points that it is a binned heatmap</A>, the greatly abbreviated
("decimated") source list overlay will be saved, <strong>NOT</strong>
the entire catalog!

<LI>If you have "pan by table row" turned on (see <a
href="visualization.html#panbytablerow">Visualization chapter</A>),
then it may be disconcerting to have the images "jump" right after the
catalog loads. It is centering the selected catalog object (the first
one upon catalog loading) in the viewer. If you don't like this, turn
off "pan by table row".

<LI>By default, it may show you fewer columns than are available in
the full catalog. By selecting "long form" (above the list of
columns), you can access the full range of available columns. In some
cases, there are literally hundreds of columns that you can access!

</ul><P>

The search results are then shown and <a
href="#interacting">interacted with</A> in the same way as the other
catalogs described here.<P>


<h3><A name="nedcatalogs">NED Objects</A> -- Searching for NED objects</h3>

(NED= <A href="http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">NASA
Extragalactic Database <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>.)<P>

By clicking on the blue "Catalogs" tab, you are by default dropped
into the interface for searching for catalogs at IRSA. However, you
can pick another tab, "NED", to search for and load objects from
a cone search at NED.<P>

<img src="img/nedcat.png" width="75%"><P>

As for the other catalog searches, the tool pre-fills the target
position with its best guess of the coordinates of the target with
which you have been working. You can use an object name in place of
coordinates. Note that although NED is used for name resolution, the
actual search is then performed using coordinates, as opposed to name.
In this case, you are limited to a cone
search, so the next option is the cone search radius. Pick your units
from the pulldown first, and then enter a number; if you enter a
number and then select from the pulldown, it will convert your number
from the old units to the new units. There are both upper and lower
limits to your search radius; it will tell you if you request
something too big or too small. <P>

From the NED results, you have one-click access to the fully detailed
information from NED on any object returned from such a search.
The search results will generally include a column "Details", though
you may have to scroll to the right to see it. Clicking on a link in
this column takes you directly to the full NED information display for
the selected object in a new window.
<P>

The search results are then shown and <a
href="#interacting">interacted with</A> in the same way as the other
catalogs described here.<P>


<h3><a name="owncatalogs">Loading your own catalogs from disk</A></h3><P>

By clicking on the blue "Catalogs" tab, you are by default dropped
into the interface for searching for catalogs at IRSA. However, you
can pick another tab from the top, "Load Catalog File", to load your own
catalog.<P>

<img src="img/owncat.png" width="75%"><P>

You may upload a file from disk, from the web via a URL, or from the
<a href="/docs/workspace/" target="_blank">IRSA Workspace <img
src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>.

The file can be in any of a number of formats, which we now briefly
describe. <P>

<DL>
<DT><strong>IPAC table format (*.tbl)</strong>
<DD> <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/DDGEN/Doc/ipac_tbl.html"
target="_blank">IPAC table format <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></A> is plain text with a particular formating. IRSA has a
<a href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/TblValidator/"
target="_blank">table reformatting and validation service <img
src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A> which may be helpful, or you
can download just about any catalog you find through IRSA, and mimic
that format.<P>

Your table file MUST have RA and Dec values, and unless it is
specified, it assumes J2000.<P>

You can add a "SYMBOL" parameter to change the shape
(X, SQUARE, CROSS, EMP_CROSS, DIAMOND, DOT) of catalog marks, e.g.:
<pre>
\SYMBOL = X
</pre>
<P>

You can add a "DEFAULT_COLOR" parameter to assign a CSS color name or
a HEX value to catalog marks, e.g., either of these two:
<pre>
\DEFAULT_COLOR = lightcyan
\DEFAULT_COLOR = #00FF00
</pre>
You can find the <a
href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp"
target="_blank">CSS color code or the CSS color HEX values <img
src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A> online.<P> 

<DT><strong>Comma-separated values (CSV) format (*.csv)</strong>
<DD> CSV format is often accepted by spreadsheet programs, and most
spreadsheet programs can output CSV. It is plain text, with values for
each column separated by commas.<P>

<dt><strong>Tab-separated values (TSV) format (*.tsv)</strong>
<DD> TSV format is sometimes accepted (or generated) by spreadsheet
programs, and sometimes in tabular data downloaded from journal
articles from the 90s. It is plain text, with values for each column
separated by tab characters. <P>

<dt><strong>VOTable (*.vot)</strong>
<dd>Virtual Observatory (VO) tables are a special case of XML tables.
(All VO Tables are XML but not all XML are VO Tables.)
It is a format developed by the International Virtual Observatory
Alliance (more information <a
href="https://www.ivoa.net/documents/VOTable/20191021/index.html"
target="_blank">here <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>). XML
tables initially look to the human eye like it might be HTML, but they
are easier to parse with code. There are packages in astropy that
handle VO Tables.<P>

<DT><strong>FITS files (*.fits)</strong>
<DD>Flexible image transport system (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FITS"target="_blank">FITS <img
src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>) files are widely used in
astronomy and are an easy way to store images. FITS tables can be loaded
into this tool. Note that this tool is flexible enough to handle
multiple header data units (HDUs), so that you can upload a FITS file
that has both images and tables. You can specify which HDU you would
like to load, and if you choose more than one image, it will give you
a choice of loading them into individual frames or all into one frame.
For more information on loading images this way, see <a
href="visualization.html#catalogload">this section</A>.<P>

<DT><strong>Region files (*reg)</strong>
<DD>Region files are plain text overlays originally used in <a
href="http://ds9.si.edu/doc/ref/region.html" target="_blank">ds9 <img
src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>. Regions files can be overlaid
on images (see <a href="visualization.html#ds9regions">here</A>), but
they can be loaded from this portion of the tool, and overlaid on
images that way.<P>

<dt><strong>MOC FITS files</strong>
<DD>A <A href="https://ivoa.net/documents/MOC/"
target="_blank">multi-order coverage map (MOC) <img
src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A> is  a format developed by the
International Virtual Observatory Alliance to specify sky regions. You
might use this kind of file to describe the region over which a given
survey has observations. These files can also be loaded into this
tool.<P>

</dl>


Nearly every file you load will result in a preview of the file you
have uploaded. Examples include the following:

Uploading a CSV file with many columns:<br>
<img src="img/catuploadex1.png" width="100%"><P>

Uploading an IPAC table file with minimal columns:<br>
<img src="img/catuploadex2.png" width="100%"><P>

Uploading a multi-HDU FITS file containing a mixture of tables and
images. (Note that in this case, all planes are selected and the lower
left gives a choice for loading all the images into one window or one
extension per window.)<br>
<img src="img/catuploadex3.png" width="100%"><P>

Uploading a FITS file with multiple image planes where only one plane
is selected:<br>
<img src="img/catuploadex4.png" width="100%"><P>

After you verify that the tool is reading your file correctly, and, if
applicable, selected the HDU(s) you wish to load, click "Load" to load
the file into the tool.<P>



<strong>Tips and Troubleshooting</strong> 
<UL>
<LI>If you would like to have your catalog overlaid on an image,
it needs to have RA and Dec columns. If the tool doesn't seem to
recognize your RA and Dec columns, check your formatting, or try
headers of "ra" instead of "RA" and "dec" instead of "DEC" or "Dec". 
<LI>Unless specified, the tool assumes any coordinates you give it are
J2000.
<LI>If there are no discernible positions in the uploaded file, it
will still let you plot columns from the file after you've loaded it.
<LI>If you have multiple HDUs in your file, you can load a plane, and
then come back to the the "Load catalog file" tab to pick another HDU
without having to upload it again.
</UL>

catalogs described here.<P>



<a name="tapSearches.form"></A>
<h3><A name="votap">VO TAP Search</A> -- Searching for catalogs via VO TAP services</h3>

(VO= <A href="http://www.virtualobservatory.org/"
target="_blank">Virtual Observatory <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></A> and TAP = <a
href="https://www.ivoa.net/documents/TAP/" target="_blank">table
access protocol <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>.) TAP
services enable complex queries of tables using astronomical data
query language (<a href="https://www.ivoa.net/documents/ADQL/"
target="_blank">ADQL <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>).<P>

There are myriad places on the web to learn more about TAP queries and
ADQL. We just provide a brief overview here in the context of this
tool. This is what the search screen looks like by default:<P>

<img src="img/votapsearch.png" width="75%"><P>

<DL>
<DT>
<a name="tapSearches.tapService"><strong>Select TAP
Service</strong></A><P>

<DD>There are many TAP services available, worldwide. By default, this
tool uses IRSA's TAP service, but you can choose others via
the pulldown menu, or just start typing in your TAP URL.<P>

<DT><a name="tapSearches.selectBy"><strong>Select Query Type</strong></A><P>

<dd>You can choose to have a UI-assisted single table query, or edit the
ADQL directly. By using the "Single Table (UI assisted)" option, you
can select pre-defined options and have the interface construct the
query in ADQL. Alternatively, if you are already fluent in ADQL, you
can select the second option, "Edit ADQL", to construct even more
complext queries. <P>

We first describe the rest of the screen for the "Single Table (UI
assisted)" option (as seen in the screenshot above), and then the rest
of the screen for the "Edit ADQL (advanced)" option.<P>

<dt><a name="tapSearches.selectTable"><strong>Select Table</strong></A><P>

<dd>You first need to select the Table Collection (Schema), which in the
case of IRSA's TAP service is the same as "project" in an
IRSA-exclusive search. Then, having selected that, the pull-down menu
on the right changes to reflect the tables available under that
schema. <P>

<strong>Tips and Troubleshooting</strong>: Not every table available via this
interface even has RA/Dec or, if it does, it may not be searchable via
positions. Make sure that you have selected a table that contains what
you need before proceeding past this step.<P>


<dt><a name="tapSearches.constraints"><strong>Enter Constraints</strong></A><P>

<dd>There are two sections to this step. <P>

On the <strong>left</strong>, you can impose a variety of constraints.
In addition to selecting the tickbox indicating that you wish to
impose a particular kind of constraints, you need to specify which
columns should be used for those constraints. <a
href="#moreconstraints">More information  on these constraints is
below.</A> <P>

On the <strong>right</strong> is a list of the columns in the selected
table, with tickboxes to indicate which columns will be returned. You
can also set constraints on the columns from here, following the <a
href="tables.html#filters">same filter rules as for any tables
here</A>. Above this section of the screen, there is an indication of
which columns are selected (e.g., 45 of 298 columns). You can reset
the column selection via the button here as well.<P>

<dt><strong>Actually doing it</strong>
<dd>To initiate the search, click "Search." To cancel it, click
"Cancel." You can impose a constraint on the number of returned rows
here. Finally, the "Populate and edit ADQL" button takes the
parameters you have entered, creates the ADQL, and launches the "Edit
ADQL (advanced)" interface.<P>

<dt><a name="tapSearches.adql"><strong>Advanced ADQL</strong></A>
<DD>
<img src="img/voadql.png" width="75%"><P>
You can get to this screen by selecting "Edit ADQL (advanced)" in step
two, or by clicking on "Populate and edit ADQL" after filling out the
UI. <P>

You can select the schema from the left side of the screen. Each of
the schemas can expand into viable tables and then columns within each
table via clicking on the "+" to the left of the folder icon. Click on
a column name to have it appear at the location of your cursor in the
ADQL query box on the right. If you have the tickbox checked on the
right that says "Insert fully-qualified column names", clicking on the
column name inserts fully-qualified column names at your cursor
location in the box. <P>

You can type the ADQL directly into the box. If you configured a
search on the "Single Table (UI assisted)" page, this box is already
pre-filled with the ADQL version of your search, and you can proceed
to edit it further. <P>

Examples of useful functions and queries are given on the lower
right.<P>

<strong>Tips and Troubleshooting</strong>: If you have arrived at this page
from the "Populate and edit ADQL" button, this is a one-way trip --
any changes you make to the ADQL here are NOT transmitted
automatically back to the "Single Table (UI Assisted)" query page.<P>

</dl><P>


<strong><a name="moreconstraints">More information about
constraints</A></strong><P>

You can have several different ways of constraining your search
depending on the options you have selected before the "Enter
Constraints" section, and the options depend on what kind of service
is available at the TAP service you have selected. If the options do
not appear initially, click on the black triangle to "unfold" the
options.<P>

<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="tapSearches.spatial">Enter Constraints:

<dd>
This part of the interface allows you to specify which columns of the
catalog are to be used for coordinates, and to impose a cone search on
a given target, or a polygon search.<P>

<h3><A name="voscs">VO SCS Search</A> -- Searching for catalogs via VO SCS services</h3>


(VO= <A href="http://www.virtualobservatory.org/" target="_blank">Virtual
Observatory <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A> and SCS =
simple cone search.)<P>

By clicking on the blue "Catalogs" tab, you are by default dropped
into the interface for searching for catalogs at IRSA. However, you
can pick another tab, "VO SCS Search", to search for
and load catalogs from the VO simple cone search services.<P>

<br><img src="img/vocatalogs.png" width="75%"><br>
<P>

As for the IRSA catalog search, the tool tries to pre-fill the target
position with the coordinates of the target with which you have been
working. In this case, you are limited to a cone search, so the next
option is the cone search radius. As usual, pick your units from the
pulldown first, and then enter a number; if you enter a number and
then select from the pulldown, it will convert your number from the
old units to the new units. There are both upper and lower limits to
your search radius; it will tell you if you request something too big
or too small. <P>

If you know your VO URL already, you can jump down to the Cone Search
URL box and type or paste your URL into the box and hit search.<P>

More commonly, however, users do not know <em>a priori</em> which URL
to use. Click on "Find Astronomical Data Resources" to be droped into
a VO search. Find the URL corresponding to the catalog you want, copy
it, and go back and paste it in the URL box. The URL should not have
the RA and Dec in it; the tool will add your RA and Dec as listed to
the URL in the right syntax. Click on
"Search" to initiate the search. <P>

The search results are then shown (and interacted with) in the same way as
the other catalogs described here.<P>

<strong>Example</strong><p>

Load the tool. Search on IC1396. Go to the catalogs tab. Choose "VO
Catalog." It wants the root URL for a cone search. Click on "Find
Astronomical Data Resources", which goes <a
href="http://vao.stsci.edu/keyword-search/" target="_blank">here <img
src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>. Search on IPHAS. Get <a
href="http://vao.stsci.edu/keyword-search/?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search_field=all_fields&q=iphas"
target="_blank">this page <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>.
Look for the complete catalog release (not just one associated with
one specific study). The name of the catalog goes <a
href="http://vao.stsci.edu/directory/getRecord.aspx?id=ivo://CDS.VizieR/II/321"
target="_blank">here <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>. Hit
the [+] to expand it. There is one URL listed there, under "available
endpoints for the standard interface." Copy that URL and paste it into
the search form. The IRSA tool will append your coordinates and radius
and return you a table.<P>

<strong>Tips and Troubleshooting</strong> 
<UL>
<LI>
Note that searching the VO means that you are using resources not
specifically housed at IRSA, so servers may be down, or timeouts set,
or limits on numbers of returned sources, etc., that are beyond our
control. In most cases the solution is to specify as precise a search
as possible.  The URL you enter into the box in Finder Chart must be a
Cone Search base URL (not containing RA and Dec parameters, which are
inserted into the URL by the tool in response to the search
parameters you give it).

<LI>The master list of registries is <a href="http://rofr.ivoa.net/"
target="_blank">here <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>. You
can also search the registries directly via that link (as opposed to
via the IRSA tools).

<h3><A name="interacting">Interacting with catalogs</A></h3>

When you load a catalog, the tools may create a table, a plot, and/or,
if your catalog has position information (e.g., RA and dec), it
overlays the catalog on an image. All three of these ways of
displaying the catalog are interlinked and interactive.<P>

Catalogs are a special case of <a href="tables.html">tables</A>; the
basic functionality of tables is covered in the <a
href="tables.html">Tables section</A>. You can sort and filter the
table.<P>

<A href="plots.html">Plots</A> are also covered in a different
section. You can make scatter plots, heat maps, and histograms. You
can plot columns from your catalog, including simple mathematical
manipulations of catalog columns.<P>

If the catalog has positions included and the tool has an image
display, the catalog will also be overlaid on an image. The <a
href="visualization.html">Visualization section</A> includes
information about that. Each catalog that you load is overlaid on
the image using different, customizable symbols and colors. <P>
