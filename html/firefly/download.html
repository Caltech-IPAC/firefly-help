<h3><a name="intro">Introduction</A></h3>


You can download images and tables and plots from Firefly. The
Background Monitor helps keep track of downloads placed in the
background. <P>

<hr width="50%">
<h3><A NAME="images">Images</A></h3>

If you want to save an image, click on the image you want to save so
that it has the brown highlighted box around it. The diskette icon
(<img src="img/save.png"> ) in the image toolbar is within the tools
drop-down (<img src="img/toolsdropdown-small.png">), and that will
allow you to save that currently selected image as a FITS file (or <a
href="visualization.html#saveimage">other formats</A>, including
saving just the overlays).  Note that <b>you</b> control where the
file is saved on your disk through your browser; your browser may be
configured to store all downloads in a particular location on your
disk. <P>


<hr width="50%">
<h3><A NAME="tables">Tables</A></h3>

On the upper right of any table shown in the tool, there is a diskette
option: <img src="img/savetable.png">. Click on this icon to save the
table; you have a <a href="tables.html#save">variety of choices</A> of
file format. <P>


<hr width="50%">
<h3><A NAME="plots">Plots</A></h3>

To save a plot, click on the diskette icon (<img src="img/save.png">).
The plot will be saved to your disk as a png file.<P>


<hr width="50%">
<h3><A NAME="preparedownload">Prepare Download</A></h3>

Some windows may have a button that reads "Prepare Download." If that
button appears, then you just have to select the rows corresponding to
the data (or data product) you wish to download -- tick the tickbox on
the far left of the corresponding row, or tick the box at the top of
the column to "select all" -- and then click "Prepare Download." It
may ask you for additional information, like how much ancillary
information you want, and what the filename you want for the zip
files. If you ask for a lot of data, the packaging will likely need to
spin off to the <a href="#bgmon">Background Monitor</A>.<P>


<hr width="50%">
<h3><A NAME="filelocation">File Location</A></h3>

The files that you are saving can go to your own disk, or to the <a
href="/docs/workspace/" target="_blank">IRSA Workspace <img
src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>. <P>

<LI><strong>You</strong> control where the file is saved on your disk
through your browser; your browser may be configured to store all
downloads in a particular location on your disk. Try looking in a
"Downloads" directory, or for "recently modified files."

<h3><A NAME="bgmon">Background Monitor</A></h3>


The Background Monitor appears as blue text <img src="img/bgmon.png">
in the upper right of your window to keep track of the data downloads
you have requested.  It actively changes to reflect what it is doing
(e.g., this is preparing a download or catalog: <img
src="img/preparing.png">)  Larger catalog requests can be sent to the
Background Monitor.   <P>

A pop-up window can be called up at any time by clicking the
"Background Monitor" tab.  You can watch your data being retrieved. It
will update that window when the data are available for download
and/or overlay on your image, providing a link (or links) for
obtaining the data.  Remove them from the list by clicking on the 
'x'. <br> <img src="img/backgroundpopup.png" height="180" style="border:3px solid
gray"> <img src="img/backgroundpopup2.png" height="180" style="border:3px solid
gray"><P>

If you have made, say, a large catalog request and don't want the
pending catalog request to occupy screen space while it loads, you can
click on the button marked "send to background" to reclaim your screen
space, seen here:<br>
<img src="img/background-sendto.png"><br>
When the background monitor finishes, however, you will have to
actively tell it to display results; it doesn't do it automatically if
you have sent it to the background.
You can ask it to send you email when it is ready by clicking on the
"enable email notification" and giving it an email address.<br>

To stop any query mid-way through, click on the little red octagon
("stop sign") that appears next to the query in the Background Monitor
pop-up.<P>

If you forgot to put in your email at the beginning, or if the
packaging is taking longer than you expected, you can click on "Enable
email notification" from the bottom of the Background Monitor popup
and add your email during the packaging process. <P>
<img src="img/backgroundemail.png" height="180" style="border:3px solid
gray"> <P>

If you are having technical difficulties, click on the circle with an
"i" in it to get additional information, like this:<br>
<img src="img/backgroundinfo.png" height="180" style="border:3px solid
gray"><br>
In this case, the job is executing, at the time as given, with a job
id as shown.<P>
