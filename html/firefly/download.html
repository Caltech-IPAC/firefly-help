<h3><a name="intro">Introduction</A></h3>


You can download images and tables and plots from Firefly. The
<a href="jobmon.html">Job Monitor</A> helps keep track of downloads
placed in the background.  <P>

<hr width="50%">
<h3><A NAME="images">Images</A></h3>

If you want to save an image, click on the image you want to save so
that it has the brown highlighted box around it. The diskette icon
(<img src="img/save.png"> ) in the image toolbar is within the tools
drop-down (<img src="img/toolsdropdown-small.png">), and that will
allow you to save that currently selected image as a FITS file (or <a
href="visualization.html#saveimage">other formats</A>, including
saving just the overlays).  Note that <b>you</b> control where the
file is saved on your disk through your browser; your browser may be
configured to store all downloads in a particular location on your
disk. <P>


<hr width="50%">
<h3><A NAME="tables">Tables</A></h3>

On the upper right of any table shown in the tool, there is a diskette
option: <img src="img/savetable.png">. Click on this icon to save the
table; you have a <a href="tables.html#save">variety of choices</A> of
file format. <P>


<hr width="50%">
<h3><A NAME="plots">Plots</A></h3>

To save a plot, click on the diskette icon (<img src="img/save.png">).
The plot will be saved to your disk as a png file.<P>


<hr width="50%">
<h3><A NAME="preparedownload">Prepare Download</A></h3>

Some windows may have a button that reads "Prepare Download." If that
button appears, then you just have to select the rows corresponding to
the data (or data product) you wish to download -- tick the tickbox on
the far left of the corresponding row, or tick the box at the top of
the column to "select all" -- and then click "Prepare Download." It
may ask you for additional information, like how much ancillary
information you want, and what the filename you want for the zip
files. If you ask for a lot of data, the packaging will likely need to
spin off to the <a href="jobmon.html">Job Monitor</A>.<P>

<hr width="50%">
<h3><A NAME="scripts">Scripts</A></h3>

Depending on how you choose to download the data and specifically what
archive you use, but particularly if you <a
href="jobmon.html#email">get an email from the Job Monitor</A>, you
may get a curl or wget script that you can execute on your computer to
download the files you have requested, or you may choose to obtain
just a list of URLs that you can feed to your own code to download the
data. The scripts are designed to echo to the screen updates on what
they are doing, so that you can track the download's progress.<P>

To use these, save the script to a plain text file, and invoke the
script. You may need to do something at the commmand line like "chmod
+x script.sh" and then "./script.sh" to invoke it.  You could also
copy and paste the script lines individually into your terminal
window. <P>

Generally speaking, the wget script is best for Linux and Unix users.
The curl script is best for Mac users, because curl is part of the
standard OS distribution; Mac users can also go retrieve and install
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/" target="_blank">wget <img
src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A> and then use the wget
scripts.<P>

Double-clicking on the downloaded zip files should uncompress them,
and then you should be off and running. However, some Windows users
have reported having difficulty unzipping files. We recommend using <a
href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html" target="_blank">7-zip <img
src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>.<P>


<hr width="50%">
<h3><A NAME="filelocation">File Location</A></h3>

The files that you are saving can go to your own disk, or to the <a
href="/docs/workspace/" target="_blank">IRSA Workspace <img
src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>. <P>
