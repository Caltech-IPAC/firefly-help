<h2>Firefly: Spectra</h2>

Visualization of spectra use capabilities of  <a
href="tables.html">Tables</A>, (image) <a
href="visualization.html">Visualization</A>, and <a
href="plots.html">Plots</A>. Generic help on those capabilities can be
found in those other sections; spectra are a special case of all of
those, and this section attempts to build on that by collecting all
the spectra-specific information in one place.<P>

<h3><A name="loading">Loading Spectra</A></h3>

The first step to using the spectral features in this tool is getting
the tool to recognize that you have a spectrum.<P>

When you <a href="upload.html#spectra">upload your own
files</A> from disk, if you load a table, there is an option that
appears at the bottom left of the screen:<br> <img
src="img/interptabspec.png"><br> If you tick this box, and your data
are formatted consistently with (or at least close to) the <a
href="https://ivoa.net/documents/SpectrumDM/20111120/index.html"
target="_blank">IVOA SpectrumDM v1.1 data model <img
src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>, then the tool will recognize
the data as a spectrum.<P>

There is some flexibility in the interpreter, so if you think your
file is close to the standard, give it a try. The computer might be
able to figure it out.<P>



<hr width="50%">
<h3><A name="extracting">Extracting Spectra</A></h3>

Alternatively, you can get spectra into Fireefly by extracting them
from an image file. If you have a multi-HDU file where the planes are
different wavelengths (such as can be found in data from <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/Missions/sofia.html">SOFIA <img
src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>), <a
href="visualization.html#extraction">use the drill extraction
tool</A>, and "pin" the extraction, then the tool will also recognize
the extracted data as a spectrum. It will also (attempt to) propagate
the errors correctly.<P>



<hr width="50%">
<h3><A name="plotting">Plotting Spectra</A> </h3>

Spectra are plotted automatically when loaded. By default, they are
plotted as F-sub-nu vs. lambda in microns, with connected points. At
least, this is what it attempts to do, if it understands the units of
the file you have given it. If it understands the units, it will
convert them appropriately. If it doesn't understand the units, it may
serve them to you in the same units it received. <P>

When spectra are plotted, changing what is plotted by clicking on the
gears is similar to, but not quite the same as, <a
href="plots.html#changing">the generic case</A>. Now, because it knows
it is plotting a spectrum, you can select the x- and y-axis columns
and units from a pre-defined set of choices in the drop-down menus,
where it will convert the units when necessary.<P>

It is probably most efficient to demonstrate plotting of spectra via
specific examples.<P>

<table><tr><td><img src="img/spectraplot3.png"  width="400"
style="border:3px solid gray"> </td><td>In this example, the tool has
identified the spectral axis as 'wavelength', understood the units,
converted them to microns, and is showing them in the observed
reference frame. It has identified the flux axis column as 'FLUX' and
the corresponding error as 'ERROR', and understood the units as Jy.
From the drop-down menus, you can choose to convert the wavelength to
Angstroms, nanometers, microns, millimeters, centimeters, or meters.
You can choose to convert the flux density to Janskys or
Watts/meter^2/Hertz. It is plotting the spectrum as connected points,
with error bars.  <br> <img src="img/spectrum3.png" width="400"
style="border:3px solid gray"></td></tr></table> <P>

<a name="orders">&nbsp;</A>
<table><tr><td><img src="img/spectraplot.png" height="400"
style="border:3px solid gray"> </td><td>In this second example, the
tool is struggling a bit more. It has identified the spectral axis
column as 'wavelength' and is showing it in the observed frame, but it
is guessing about the units; they only appear in the plot. It has
identified the flux axis column as "flux_density", it has identified
the errors as "error", and it has understood those units as Jy. It is
showing the spectrum with connected points. Note too that in this
case, there are several spectral orders; at the top, you can see that
there is "choose trace" -- it turns out that there are four orders in
this spectrum, and it is <a
href="plots.html#overplotting">overplotting</A> all four on the same
plot, with errors.<br> <img src="img/spectrum1.png" width="400"
style="border:3px solid gray"></td></tr></table><P>

<table><tr><td><img src="img/spectraplot2.png" height="400"
style="border:3px solid gray"> </td><td>In this less well-behaved
example, the tool has identified the spectral axis column as
'wavelength' and has figured out the units of it, shown in in microns,
in the observed frame. The flux axis column in this case is just
"HDU#0", so it is completely confused. It hasn't figured out what to
do about errors at all. It is showing the spectrum with connected
points.<br> <img src="img/spectrum2.png" width="400" style="border:3px
solid gray"></td></tr></table>

<P>

In all of these cases, you don't have as much flexibility in these
plots as you do for <a href="plots.html">plots in general</A>, but the
options you do have are highly customized to spectra, such as
redshifts. See the next section!<P>


<hr width="50%">
<h3><A name="redshifting">Redshifting Spectra</A> </h3>

When the tool recognizes the wavelength axis, it offers you a choice of
redshifting the spectrum. By default, it assumes you want to plot the
data as observed:<br>
<img src="img/redshift1.png" style="border:3px solid gray"><br>
but if you pick "Rest Frame":<br>
<img src="img/redshift2.png" style="border:3px solid gray"><br>
you can enter a redshift, and it shows you how it adjusts the
wavelength axis accordingly:<br>
<img src="img/redshift3.png" style="border:3px solid gray">
<P>

Click 'Apply' to implement these changes in the plot. The axis labels
on the plot correspondingly change.<P>

To change back to the data as observed, simply pick "Observed Frame"
from the drop-down menu.<P>

<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="overplotting">Overplotting Spectra</A></h3>

The <a href="plots.html#overplotting">Plots section</A> covers
overplotting in general, and the example given there is a
color-magnitude diagram. However, the reason why there is overplotting
capability in the tool at all is to support overplotting spectral
orders from a given spectrum on the same plot. <P>

If you load in a spectrum with multiple orders and just try to plot it
without convincing the tool that the data are a spectrum, you get, by
default, the plot on the left. But, if you let the tool know that the
file you have uploaded is, in fact, a spectrum, you get the plot on
the right, where the four orders in this spectrum are overplotted in
different colors.<P> 

<img src="img/overplottedspectra.png" width="100%"><p>

If you use the plot options (click on the gears <img
src="img/gears.png" align="center"> icon), you can change the plot
parameters. It has options similar to what you get for generic
plotting, but limited as in the above, specifically for plotting
spectra:<br> <img src="img/overplotparams.png" width="400"
style="border:3px solid gray"><p>




<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="combining">Combining Plots</A> </h3>

<A href="plots.html#pinning">Pinning plots</A> is covered in the
generic plots section, but in brief, pinning allows you to temporarily
'save' a given plot. <P>

When you have more than one plot pinned, this icon may appear at the
top of the plot pane: <img src="img/combinechart.png" align="bottom">
This means "Combine Chart".<P>

This option only appears if you have pinned at least two plots, and it
will only let you combine plots if it recognizes that you have spectra
loaded. <P> 

To start this process, click to select the first chart you want to
combine, then click on the "combine chart" icon. You get a  pop-up
like this:<br> <img src="img/combinechartpopup.png" width="500"
 style="border:3px solid gray"><br> All of the remaining pinned charts
that can be combined appear as a list at the top. Once you select them
via the tickboxes on the far left of the list (the first one in the
list is selected here), they appear as options on the bottom of the
pop-up window. For this example, I extracted the observed spectra from
a SOFIA FIFI-LS data cube at several sky positions. The extractions
are the default "Extraction Z-Axis - <em>n</em>". <P>

Continuing through this pop-up, you can choose to set the title of the
new plot you are about to create -- the default is "combined". <P>

The next choice is "Apply cascading." Here is what this is and why it
matters. If you are combining spectra that are nearly all the same
brightness, the spectra will be plotted on top of each other.
Sometimes that is what you want, and sometimes that is not. If you
click on the "Apply cascading" option, you have an additional
choice:<br>
<img src="img/cascadingoptions.png"><br>
This is telling you how it is going to stack the spectra on the final
plot. See below for examples with and without cascading. You can
adjust the amplitude of the cascade by changing the size of the
padding, as shown.<P>

Finally, you can change the name of the trace as displayed on the plot
(and in the pull-down menus in the tool) for each of the spectra you
are combining.<P>

Click "OK" to actually make the new plot.<P>

Here are two examples of combined spectra that were extracted from a
SOFIA FIFI-LS data cube, one without cascading, and one with
cascading. Both are useful, but in different contexts.<br>
<img src="img/combinechartexample.png" width="48%">
<img src="img/combinechartexample2.png" width="48%"><p> 


Note that after you combine a plot, there is a new drop-down at
the top of the plot that controls which trace is in the 'foreground' for
changing plot parameters or selecting points, but you can also simply
click on points in the plot to bring that trace to the foreground.<P>



<strong><font color="orange">&#x26A0;</font> Tips and Troubleshooting</strong>
<UL>
<LI>The plot you have selected when you click on "Combine Chart" is
implicitly part of the combining process, so it's not available to
select with a tickbox in the pop-up.
<LI>If you have loaded spectral files with multiple orders, each order
appears as a separate color in the plot. You can change the order
labels before or after combining.
<LI>At this time, you can't combine charts that the tool doesn't
recognize as spectra, even if they are in the same parameter space.
<LI>To delete a combined plot that you have created, just click on the 'x'
in the upper right of the plot.
