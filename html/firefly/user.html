<h2>Firefly Tools: User Registration for the IRSA Archives</h2>

There is one user registration for all IRSA applications, but data
access, preferences, search history, data tagging, etc., are all
unique to each archive.<P>

While you certainly <b>do not have to register</b> to search the
archive, download data, analyze data, and write a paper, you may wish
to register.   <P>

On the other hand, <strong><em>if you are trying to gain access to
your proprietary data in a particular archive, you will need to log
in</em></strong> so that the system grants you access to your data.
Not all archives have proprietary data.  If you got email from an
archive's Help Desk about account information, you may already have an
account; else you can set up an account (see below).  Once you have
set up an account, please send us an email at the IRSA Help Desk and
we'll tie your new account to your proprietary data.  <P>
