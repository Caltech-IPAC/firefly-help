<h2>Firefly: Tables</h2>

Firefly tables have a variety of nice features, the most prominent
being the ability to sort and filter. If you also have <a
href="visualization.html">Visualization</A> capability installed, you
can overlay catalogs on images. If you also have <a
href="plots.html">plotting</A> capability installed, you can make
plots of your table.  One specific application of Firefly tables is
astronomical catalogs; see the <a href="catalogs.html">catalogs
section</A>. <P>

<h3><A name="header">Table Header</A></h3>

Firefly tables all have the same functionality, regardless of the
contents of the table. If it looks like a Firefly table, you can work
with it whether it is a catalog, an image header, a list of results,
etc.<P>

If you have loaded a catalog into a tab and it doesn't take up  the
whole screen, to see more of the window, grab the divider between the
two window panes and slide it up, or use the expand arrow icon (<img
src="img/expand-24x24.png">) to enlarge the window pane to take up the
whole window.<P>

The table is shown exactly as it has been provided to the tool, with
all columns as defined by the creator of the table. To understand what
each column is, please see the documentation associated with that
catalog or table.<P>

The tab (and table) name itself likely indicates its origin.  To
remove the tab, it is likely that you can click on the "X" on the
tab.<P>

Immediately below the tab name, there are several symbols:<br> <img
src="img/tablehead.png"><br> which we now describe.<P>

The first thing to notice is that only the first 100 rows of the
retrieved catalog are displayed in the table. In the example here,
there are ~7,700 sources that were retrieved in the search.  The
left/right black arrows plus the page number allow you to navigate
among these 'pages' of 50 sources each.  Note that the entire set of
results (not just the 50 rows you are currently viewing) can be sorted
by clicking on any column's name. <P>


Going from left to right along the top of the catalog tab, the next
icon represents a filter: <img src="img/filter.png">  Filters are
complex and powerful enough that they are covered in a <a
href="#filters">separate section below</A>.<P>


The next icon is <img src="img/texttable.png"> -- clicking on this
changes the table display into a text display. The icon then changes
to <img src="img/table.png"> -- click this again to return to the
default table view.<P>

The next icon is <img src="img/savetable.png"> which is "Save" -- this
is how you may save the catalog. It has its <a href="#save">own
section below</A>.<P>

You may or may not see the next icon: <img src="img/infolink.png">
This is an "information" button and, if it exists, it may provide
addtional information about the table. It could have information about
the job that was used to retrieve it:<br>
<img src="img/tableinfo-jobinfo.png"><br>
where the direct link to the job is given there (and can be copied by
clicking on the clipboard, ready to be pasted into a helpdesk query,
for example), with a job id as shown. It could also just have
information about the table metadata:<br>
<img src="img/tableinfo-metadata.png"><br>
where the information about this table includes information about the
query that produced it.<P>

The next option on the top of the catalog tab is this: <img
src="img/tableoptions.png">.  Clicking on this icon brings up options
for the table, e.g., how many rows are displayed per page, which
columns are shown, whether units and data types are shown at the top
of the column, shown here:<br> <img src="img/toptableoptions.png"
width="50%"><br> By default, it is often but not always the case that
all columns are shown. The default page size is 100 rows.  Note that
expanding the page size to numbers much greater than 100 may result in
a substantial performance degradation (e.g., your browser will appear
to freeze or not appear to be doing anything while it manages and
renders the large table). See the <a href="#filters">Filters section
below</A> for more things to do from the table options pop-up. <P>

This is one of the last options on the top of the catalog tab: <img
src="img/expand-24x24.png">. Clicking on this expands the catalog
window pane to take up the entire browser window. To return to the
prior view, click on "Close" in the upper left.<P>

The last option on the top of the catalog tab may be a
context-sensitive help marker <img src="img/help.png">, which should
bring you to this online help.<P>


<h3><A name="columns">Table Columns</A></h3>

The table is shown exactly as it appears in the corresponding database
(or as it appeared on your disk), with all columns as defined for that
catalog. To understand what each column is, please see the
documentation associated with that catalog. (For IRSA catalogs, this
documentation is available via the catalog searching popup window, see
figure below, or by navigating through the IRSA website.)<br> <img
src="img/catalogcoldef.png"><P>

Depending on what you did to display a table, the columns that are
shown may be in easily-human-readable form, or may reflect column
names used within the individual catalog. Please consult the detailed
documentation associated with your specific archive if the headers are
not clear to you.<P>

There may be flexibility to display or hide columns, as described in
the <a href="#header">headers section above</A>.<P>

Clicking on the column names sorts the table by that column; clicking
once sorts in ascending order, clicking a second time sorts in
descending order, and clicking a third time returns the table to the
original order.  Small arrows appear next to the column names to
remind you if the column is sorted in ascending or descending order.

When you do a single-position search on catalogs, two new columns
could be appended to the end of the catalog as it is returned to you.
These columns are:
<UL>
<LI>dist - the distance between the source in question and the
location you specified
<LI>angle - the position angle between the target position you requested
and the object it found (degrees E of N)
</UL>

<a name="multi">
When you do a multi-position search on catalogs</A>, you could have
three new columns  prepended to the catalog as it is returned to you.
These columns are :
<UL>
<LI>cntr_01 - the target position you requested
<LI>dist_x - the distance between the target position you requested
and the object it found
<LI>pang_x - the position angle between the target position you requested
and the object it found (degrees E of N)
</UL>
These additional columns can help you assess if the target it found is
the target that should be matched to the position you requested.<P>

It could be that, when you do a multi-position search on catalogs, you
have an option for "one-to-one matching". If that is selected, tne
line (and only one line) of output is included for each line of input.
It chooses the closest source within the radius you specify, or if
there is no match, it adds a line indicating no match.  <P>





<h3><A name="filters">Table Filters</A></h3>

Filters are a <em>very</em> powerful way of exploring the table full
of search results.  Click on this icon <img src="img/filter.png"> in
order to start the process of adding filters. A text entry box appears
above each of the current catalog columns, with a small version of the
filter icon corresponding to that row on the far left. You can type
operators and values in these boxes -- hit return after typing or
click in another box to implement the filter. For fields with a
limited set of choices, instead of a text entry box, a filter icon
will appear; click on it to select from the available choices. <P>

<strong>Example:</strong> From a catalog, show only those sources
with declination above a certain value (say, 31 degrees), type "&gt;
31" in the box above the "dec" column. Or, if you have retrieved a
WISE catalog and would like to only view the objects with a W1 (3.4
micron) profile-fitted magnitude less than 6 magnitudes, above the
'w1mpro' column, type "&lt; 6" in the form.  <P>

For columns (fields) with a limited set of choices, instead
of a text entry box, an arrow next to the filter box will appear;
click on it to get a pulldown from which you can select the available
choices; to implement the filter, make the choices, and click "filter"
when you are done. Click "clear" in the pull-down menu to remove
that filter.   <P>
After you impose a filter, then the number of rows in the catalog is
restricted according to the rules you have specified, and the
"filters" icon on the top right of the catalog pane has changed to
remind you that there has been a filter applied, in this case just one
filter: <img src="img/filtersapplied.png">. To clear the filters, click on
the cancel filters icon (which also appears after you impose filters):
<img src="img/cancelfilters.png">.<P>

<em>Filters can be used in combination</em>. Note that the filters
between columns are logically "AND"ed together, but filters within the
same column can be logically "AND"ed or "OR"ed together; examples are
below.  <P>

The available logical operators are :
<UL>
<LI> =  which means 'equal to' (exactly!), e.g., the parameter on
whichyou are querying (the column headers as shown) is exactly equal to
this value you are specifying.
<LI> &gt; which means 'greater than'
<LI> &lt; which mean 'less than'
<LI> != which means 'not equal to' (exactly!)
<LI> &gt;= which means 'greater than or equal to'
<LI> &lt;= which means 'less than or equal to'
<LI> IN which means 'included within this list', e.g., the parameter
on which you are querying is included within the list you are
specifying (if the column filter is free-form text, type
"value1,value2" and it will give you rows that have value1 or value2).
<LI> LIKE which means 'resembles the text that is entered', e.g., the text
resembles the text that you type in the box.
<LI>IS which effectively is the same as =
<LI>IS NOT  which effectively is the same as !=
</UL>

<strong>Examples</strong>:
<UL>
<LI> Retain rows for which a certain parameter is not an empty
string: !=''
<LI> Retain rows for which a certain parameter is not NULL and is
larger than 1.234: &gt; 1.234 and IS NOT NULL
<LI> Retain rows that have values between -0.5 and 1.25: &gt; -05 and &lt; 1.25
<LI> Retain rows with a parameter greater than one value or exactly
equal to another value: &gt; 12345 or != 3000 
<LI>Retain rows with a parameter equal to one of the values in a list:
 IN a,b,c,d
</UL>

You can also select rows one at a time from the far left column and
then filter that down. Example: Search on anything. Select rows by
ticking the box on the left, say, every other row out of the first 12.
Click on the filter icon on the top of the column.  The filter is
imposed to only include the 6 rows you selected.<P>


You can also interactively impose filters from <a
href="plots.html">plots</A> from the catalog - see that section.<P>


If you click on the table options icon (<img
src="img/tableoptions.png">), you get a pop-up that includes a place
to filter columns. Here is an example of the tabe columns for a WISE
catalog that has been filtered to just have SNR&gt;10 for each of the
four bands:<br>
<img src="img/tablecolumnoptions.png" width="50%"><br>
You can type in constraints in the filter box in much the same way as
you can from the catalog itself; note that the column description is
included here, which may make this way of setting filters more useful
when working with a new (to you) catalog.<P>

The second tab is the advanced filter interface:<br>
<img src="img/tablefilterpopup.png" width="50%"><br>
Here, the columns are listed alphabetically on the left, the
constraints you have imposed are in the "current constraints" box, and
you can apply additional SQL constraints via the free-form text box.
Hints for syntax are given below the entry box. This window can be
resized such that you can see the whole set of hints and imposed
filters. Note that in this interface, column headers must be enclosed
within double quotes.<P>




<strong>Tips and Troubleshooting</strong>

<UL>
<LI>If you impose logically inconsistent restrictions such as
"exposure time &gt; 160" and "exposure time &lt; 100"
("&gt;160;&lt;100" in the filter box for the column marked "exposure
time"), no data will result, because no data are (can be) both less
than 160 seconds long and greater than 100 seconds long at the same
time. However, "exposure time &gt; 160 or &lt; 100" works just fine
("&gt;160 or &lt;100" in the filter box for the column marked
"exposure time").  

<LI>If you impose nonsensical filters (like using a letter where a
number should be, like "w1snr &lt; f") then it will let you know that
something has gone really wrong, and let you go back to fix it.

<LI>However, a filter like "ph_qual &lt; f" could be valid -- if the
column with which you are working is a string, then a string is a valid
filter. It is case-insensitive. For the ph_qual column in the 2MASS
catalog, the values are always three letters, such as AAA or ABA or
CUU. A filter like "ph_qual &lt; f" will operate as if you have
alphabetized the list. Any string that starts with A comes before F
and so will be retained. If you do "ph_qual &lt; BBB" then AAA will be
left in, but so will "BAU", because alphabetically, BAU preceeds BBB.

<LI>If you impose filters from a plot, it can manifest as several
filters on the catalog, e.g., one for each side of the square you have
drawn on the plot. If you want to remove, say, just one of the four
filters (rather than all of them by cancelling all filters), you can
do so from the table options pop-up. 

<LI>If you want to copy all of the "current constraints", even if the
entire field is not visible to you, you can triple-click with your
mouse to select the entire field, and then paste it into another
field or application to see what it is.

</UL>



<strong>Cancelling filters</strong><P>

After you impose a filter, then the "filters" icon on the top right of
the catalog pane has changed to remind you that there has been a
filter applied, in this case just one filter: <img
src="img/filtersapplied.png"> To clear the filters, click on the
cancel filters icon (which also appears after you impose filters):
<img src="img/cancelfilters.png">.<P>


<h3><A name="cells">Table Cells</A></h3>

Some cell values may be too long for the cell space. If that is the
case, an ellipsis ("...") will appear in the cell as you mouse over
it: <br><img src="img/cellellipsis.png"><P>

If you click on the ellipsis, you get a pull-down menu: <br><img
src="img/cellmenu.png"> from which you can choose to copy the cell
value or view it in a pop-up window.<P>

If you view it in a pop-up window, it will come up with no special
formatting:<br> <img src="img/cellpopup-noformatting.png"><br>  If the
cell has a lot of information, it may help to impose simple
formatting, which it attempts to do if you tick the box "View with
formating":<br>  <img src="img/cellpopup-formatting.png"><P>


<h3><A name="save">Saving Tables</A></h3>


Click on the diskette icon (<img src="img/save.png">), if
available, to save the table. <P>

If you have filtered the catalog down, it will save the filtered
catalog (though as of this writing,  the total number of rows
retrieved in the table header will still be the original number). <P>

You obtain this pop-up:<br>
<img src="img/savetablepopup.png" width="500"><p>


From here, you can save the table in a variety of formats:<br> <img
src="img/savetableoptions.png"><br>

It defaults to saving it as an <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/DDGEN/Doc/ipac_tbl.html"
target="_blank">IPAC table file <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></A>, which is basically ASCII text with headers
explaining the type of data in  each column, separated by vertical
bars. <P>

Other formats include comma-separated values (suitable for, e.g.,
Excel), tab-separated values, and four different versions of <A
href="http://www.ivoa.net/documents/VOTable/">VO tables <img
src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>.<P>

The filename  may include the word "gator" because, under the hood,
the software is talking to the <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/Gator/"
target="_blank">IRSA General Catalog Query Engine <img
src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>, powered by Gator.<P>



<h3><A name="navigation">Table Navigation</A></h3>

With the ability to <a href="visualization.html#extraction">extract
data</A> from images comes the ability to rather quickly drown in
tables. There is a way to navigate among a lot of table tabs that have
accumulated.<P>

This is probably best explained via an example. Here, I have tabs
showing that I have <a
href="visualization.html#extraction">extracted</A> several lines,
drills, and points from my images:<br>
<img src="img/tabnav1.png" height="30"><br>
On the far right, I have a downward pointing arrow. When I click on
this, I get a pulldown:<br>
<img src="img/tabnav2.png"><br>
This pulldown shows that the tab marked "Points 14" is in the
foreground (it is shaded yellow) and it has a filter box at the top.
That filter box at the top works just like the filters discussed <a
href="#filters">above</A>, so if I want to find the tabs with the
extracted lines, I can type "line" in the box, and it will filter down
the list, leaving only those tabs with "line" in the name:<br>
<img src="img/tabnav3.png"><br>
Then, from there, I can select the tab I want to bring to the
foreground. (When I select a tab to bring to the foreground, that tab
is also in the foreground for plotting.)<P>

In this fashion, you can navigate among many tabs that are open at the
same time.<P>
