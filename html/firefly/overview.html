<h3><A NAME="terminology">Terminology</A></h3>

The words in rectangles across the top are 'tabs.'
<img src="img/bluetabs.png"> and you can add or remove tabs from
this top level.<P>

This icon in the upper left <img src="img/hamburger.png"> pulls open a
"drawer" from the left hand side which enables you to <a
href="#drawer">add or remove tabs</A> from this top level (see <a
href="#drawer">below</A>). It also can allow you to change the <a
href="#layout">layout or appearance</A> (dark or light mode) (see <a
href="#layout">below</A>). <P>

When you have things loaded into Firefly, your browser window is
divided into "<strong>panes</strong>", like "window panes." The
contents of the panes depends on what you are doing with the tool (and
how it was implemented for you), but could include an image pane, a
catalog pane, and/or a plot pane.  You can expand any of the window
panes by clicking on the expand icon: <img src="img/expand.png"> <p>

Each of the three main kinds of 'panes' in the display has its own
toolbox in its upper right corner which operates on things in that
pane, and the basic functionality for each of these panes is covered
elsewhere in this document:
<UL>
<LI>The <a href="tables.html">Tables section</A> covers (among other
things) the tables toolbox <img src="img/tabletoolbox.png" height="30">
<LI>The <a href="plots.html">Plots section</A> covers (among other
things) the plots toolbox <img src="img/plotnav.png" height="30">
<LI>The <a href="visualization.html">Visualization section</A> covers
(among other things) the images toolbox <img src="img/toolbox.png"
height="30">
</UL>


The idea behind "<strong>pinning</strong>" is that you can retain a
given item (a plot or table or image) within the tool. "Pinning" just
means "hold on to this item within this tool." It doesn't mean "save
this plot (or image or table) to disk", nor does it mean "download the
data behind this"; it means "retain this item in this tool for now."
<P>



<hr width="50%">
<h3><A NAME="tools">Tools Overview</A></h3>

There is a chapter on <a href="images.html">images in general</A>, and
then a separate chapter on the myriad <a
href="visualization.html">visualization tools</A> available for
manipulating images.<P>

There is a chapter on <a href="tables.html">tables in general</A>, and
then separate chapters on both <a href="catalogs.html">catalogs from
IRSA</A> and <a href="plots.html">plots you can make from
catalogs</A>. You can also use VO services to conduct <a
href="othersearches.html">more complicated searches</A>, including
searches of other archives.<P>

The images, catalogs, and plots are all interlinked such that clicking
on one point in the plot highlights the same point in the catalog and
the image.<P>

Spectra are a special case of data that use images, plots, and tables,
so there is a <a href="spectra.html">special chapter on just
spectra</A>. <P>

<a href="download.html">Downloading data</A> has its own
page</A>.<P>




<hr width="50%">
<h3><A NAME="drawer">Side Menu and Adding to the Tabs Menu</A></h3>

This icon <img src="img/hamburger.png"> in the upper left pulls open a
"drawer" from the left hand side; the top of it may look something like this:

<table><tr><td>
<img src="img/drawer1.png" style="border:3px solid gray">
</td><td>
The highlighted bar ("Results" in this example) is the tab you have in
the foreground on your main window.<P>

You can use this side menu to add (or remove) blue tabs from the top
of your Firefly interface. By default, Results, <a
href="images.html">Images</A>, <a
href="othersearches.html#generaltap">TAP</A>, <a
href="catalogs.html">IRSA Catalogs</A>, and <a
href="upload.html">Upload</A> are shown.<P>

Other tabs you can add include <a
href="othersearches.html#voscs">VO SCS (Simple Cone Search)</A> and
<a href="othersearches.html#nedcatalogs">NED Objects</A>. <P>

Click on the "Hide Tab" button to hide that corresponding tab. <P>

</td></table><P>



<hr width="50%">
<h3><A NAME="layout">Side Menu and Layout/Appearance</A></h3>

This icon <img src="img/hamburger.png"> in the upper left pulls open a
"drawer" from the left hand side; the bottom of it looks like
this:<br>
<img src="img/drawer2.png" style="border:3px solid gray">
<P>

The first part of this is only available once you have some results
shown in the tool. It controls how your results are displayed. By
default, it looks like the stylized sketch as shown, with coverage and
images on the upper left, charts (plots) in the upper right, and
tables on the bottom. You have many more choices, though:<br>

<img src="img/drawer3.png" style="border:3px solid gray"> <P> 

From this menu, you can control the layout of your Results tab -- the
relative placement of your images, plots (charts), and tables. The
darker one (the top one in this example) is the currently selected
one.<P>

The bottom of the side menu controls the appearance of the tool in
your browser -- do you want it to run as light mode, dark mode, or
respect whatever preferences you have set on your system? Try out the
different modes; you may have a preference!<P>



<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="login">User Login</A></h3>

In the far upper right, there may be a link to log in.  Firefly can
remember you when you return.  See the <a href="user.html">user
registration section</A> for more information.  <P>

<hr width="50%">
<h3><A NAME="help">Getting More Help</A></h3>

The "Help" icon <img src="img/helpicon2.png"> leads you into this
online help. There are also context-sensitive help markers throughout
the tools (<img src="img/help.png">).  You can also download a PDF
version of this manual; look at the top left of the help window. (The
PDF may be easier to search than the web pages; use your PDF reader's
search function.) <P>

For additional help, you may very well need to consult the helpdesk
for the installation of Firefly that you are using.<P>
