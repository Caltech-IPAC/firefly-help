<h3><A NAME="searching">Searching for and Loading Images</A></h3>

Exactly how you search for images is likely to be a strong function of
how your version of Firefly is implemented. However, the "<a
href="visualization.html">Visualization</A>" chapter has a section on
<a href="visualization.html#newimage">Information on Loading a New
Image</A>.<P>


<h3><A NAME="images">Interacting with Images</A></h3>

The <a href="visualization.html">Visualization section</A> has
much more information about interacting with images.<P>

<h3><A NAME="tables"><A NAME="catalogs">Interacting with Tables and Catalogs</A></A></h3>

The <a href="tables.html">Tables section</A> has
much more information about interacting with tables in general.<P>

The <a href="catalogs.html">Catalogs section</A> has much more
information about interacting specifically with catalogs, including
searhing for them.<P>

You can choose from any of a wide variety of catalogs (from IRSA,
your own disk, the VO, or NED) to load and overlay on your <a
href="visualization.html">visualized data</A>. <P>


<h3><A NAME="plots"><A NAME="charts">Charts</A></A> --  Making additional plots</h3>

By default, when you load a <a href="catalogs.html">catalog</A>, you
get an x-y plot displayed as well. The "Charts" tab allows you to
create additional plots. See the <a href="plots.html">Plots
section</A> for lots more information.<P>


<h3><A NAME="bgmon">Background Monitor</A></h3>

The Background Monitor appears as a blue tab (or button) in the upper
right of your window to keep track of the data downloads you have
requested.  It actively changes to reflect what it is doing (e.g.,
this is preparing a catalog: <img src="img/preparing.png">) Larger
catalog requests can be sent to the Background Monitor.  <!--It also
can provides a <a href="downloads.html#downloadScript">download script</A>
(optional) if you have more than one package to download. --><P>

A pop-up window can be called up at any time by clicking the
"Background Monitor" tab.  You can watch your data being retrieved.
It will update that window when the data are available for download
and/or overlay on your image, providing a link (or links) for obtaining
the data. It also keeps track of the downloads you have requested
during the same session, and indicates with a checkmark those that you
have already loaded. Remove them from the list by clicking on the blue
'x'. <br>

If you have made, say, a large catalog request and don't want the
pending catalog request to occupy screen space while it loads, you can
click on the button marked "send to background" to reclaim your screen
space, seen here:<br>
<img src="img/background-sendto.png"><br>
When the background monitor finishes, however, you will have to
actively tell it to display results;it doesn't do it automatically if
you have sent it to the background.
You can ask it to send you email when it is ready by clicking on the
"enable email notification" and giving it an email address. <P>

To stop any query mid-way through, click on the little red octagon
("stop sign") that appears next to the query in the Background Monitor
pop-up.<P>

If you forgot to put in your email at the beginning, or if the
packaging is taking longer than you expected, you can click on "Enable
email notification" from the bottom of the Background Monitor popup
and add your email during the packaging process. <P>

If you forgot to put in your email at the beginning, or if the
packaging is taking longer than you expected, you can click on "Enable
email notification" from the bottom of the Background Monitor popup
and add your email during the packaging process. <P>

If you are having technical difficulties, click on the circle with an
"i" in it to get additional information, like this:<br>
<img src="img/backgroundinfo.png"><br>
In this case, the job is executing, at the time as given, the link is
given there (and can be copied by clicking on the clipboard, ready to
be pasted into a helpdesk query), with a job id as shown.<P>
