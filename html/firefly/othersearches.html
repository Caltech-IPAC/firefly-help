<h2>Firefly: Other Searches</h2>

There are several other searches you can add to Firefly using the  <a
href="overview.html#drawer">side menu to add to the tabs at the
top</A>. This chapter covers most of these choices. Basically, all of
them amount to VO TAP searches that retrieve some sort of <a
href="tables.html">tables</A>, many of which are <a
href="catalogs.html">catalogs</A>.  For the results of any of these
searches, if the tool recognizes positions in a catalog, it will
overlay the catalog on <a href="images.html">images</A> and <a
href="plots.html">make plots</A>. <P>

<h3><A name="intro">Introduction &amp; Terminology</A></h3>

There is a lot of terminology in this chapter to understand.
<UL>
<LI>VO = <A href="http://www.virtualobservatory.org/"
target="_blank">Virtual Observatory <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></A> 
<LI>TAP = <a href="https://www.ivoa.net/documents/TAP/"
target="_blank">table access protocol <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></A>. TAP services enable complex queries of tables using ADQL.  
<LI>ADQL = <a href="https://www.ivoa.net/documents/ADQL/"
target="_blank">astronomical data. 
query language <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>
<LI>ObsCore = <a href="https://www.ivoa.net/documents/ObsCore/"
target="_blank">core components of Observation Data Model <img
src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>
<LI>Data model = A standard logical structure for a type of dataset;
more flexible and general than a data format. 
<LI>ObsTAP = TAP service that serves ObsCore tables
<LI>SCS = simple cone search.
</UL>

There are myriad places on the web to learn more about TAP queries and
ADQL, as well as all the rest of the VO standards and protocols. We
just provide a brief overview here in the context of this tool. <P>

Firefly can help you interactively create ADQL which then you can
copy and use in your own code elsewhere.<P>

By using TAP and ObsTAP queries, you can use IRSA (or someone else's)
services to talk to other archives that also comply with these
standards, world-wide.<P>

The first several parts of this section talk more generally about 
interactive target refinement and constraints that are common to more
than one of the searches discussed here. Specifics of particular
searches follow after that.<P>



<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="hips.visualselection">
<a name="interactivetarget">Interactive Target Refinement</A></A></h3>


Whenever you see this icon <img src="img/clicktosearch.png"> in
Firefly, you can click on it to bring up a window to
<strong>interactively refine your target selection via clicking on a
HiPS map</strong>. Here, we are using a TAP search to demonstrate this
process, but you can find this kind of target refinement in several
places in Firefly.<P>

When you click on the icon <img
src="img/clicktosearch.png"> you bring up a window:<P>
<table><tr><td><img src="img/clicktosearch1.png" width="500" style="border:3px solid gray"></td><td>
If you have entered a target already, the window arrives already
centered on the target. If not, it is centered on the galactic center,
zoomed out. If you have entered a cone search radius already, then the
circle drawn on the image is that cone size. You can manipulate this
image with the same basic tools as in the <a
href="visualization.html">visualization tools</A>.
</td></tr></table><P>
<table><tr><td><img src="img/clicktosearch2.png" width="500" style="border:3px solid gray"></td><td>
To change the search region interactively, choose the selection
tools and draw a shape on the image.<P>
<strong>Note that</strong> if you have selected a cone search on the
left, no matter what you select on the right, it will give you a cone
search. If you change the cone position or radius in the yellow boxes
after you change the selection, it will update the region in the
image. </td></tr></table><P>
<table><tr><td><img src="img/clicktosearch3.png" width="500" style="border:3px solid gray"></td><td>
If you want to quit out of the selection without changing, click on
"end selection" (the brown text near the top of the image). 
 </td></tr></table><P>
<table><tr><td><img src="img/clicktosearch4.png" width="500" style="border:3px solid gray"></td><td>
If you select polygon on the left, and you use the selection tool for
"cone selection" on the right, you will get a spherical polygon
(a polygon where the line segments are on a sphere).
 </td></tr></table>
<P>
When you are done with this pop-up window, click on the 'x' in the
upper right of the window. Then you can continue with whatever you
were doing before you started to refine your target parameters.<P>

<h3><a name="moreconstraints">VO TAP Searches: More information about
constraints</A></h3><P>

You can have several different ways of constraining your search
depending on the options you have selected before the "Enter
Constraints" section, and the options depend on what kind of service
is available at the TAP service you have selected. If the options do
not appear initially, click on the downward arrow to "unfold" the
options.<P>

<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="tapSearches.spatial">Enter Constraints:
Spatial</A></strong>

This part of the interface allows you to specify the details of a
spatial search. You need to specify both what kind of search you want
to do and which columns of the catalog are to be used for
coordinates.<P>

resolution options as in any other search here.</td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td>
<img src="img/enterconstraints-spatial2.png" width="500" style="border:3px solid gray">

And, this is what it looks like when you do a <strong>single target polygon
search</strong>. The search areas here (visible, selection, and
custom) are the same as when you do a polygon search on <a

you want the catalog request to match the entire area of the image you
have selected ("image"), or just the portion of the image you can see
in the current view ("visible"), or your own ("custom") area. The list
of vertices in the coordinates box are in decimal RA and Dec in
degrees. You must enter at least 3 and at most 15 vertices, separated
by a comma. <P>

(correctly) guessed that the position columns are "ra" and "dec". If
it guesses wrong, or can't figure it out, you can help it along by
clicking on the down-arrow to 'expand' that part of the panel and
selecting the two coordinate columns to use.  </td></tr></table><P>

<strong><font color="orange">&#x26A0;</font> Tips and Troubleshooting</strong>
<UL>
<LI>The names have to match exactly, so in the case of this example,
since the Gaia column source_id is a long, the IPAC table file must
also cast the Gaia ID as a long. 
<LI>If the catalog to which you are matching is not indexed by the
name column you are using, the search may take a long time.
<LI>If you are doing, say, an object ID search, you need to turn off the
position search, otherwise it doesn't understand what you want it to
do.

<h3><a name="tapSearches.form"></A>
<A name="irsavotap"></A>
<A name="generaltap">General VO TAP Search</A></h3>

To see a TAP search tab as a choice on the top, you may need to select it from
the <a href="overview.html#drawer">side menu</A>. 


This is what a VO TAP search screen looks like by default:<P>

<img src="img/votapsearch.png" width="100%" style="border:3px solid gray"><P>

<dL>
<dt><strong>Just do it: a quick start</strong><P>

<dd> 
<strong>Select TAP Service</strong>:  It comes up ready to search on
<em>IRSA's TAP service</em>. You can select your favorite from the
drop-down menu, or use the toggle on the left to enter your own custom
URL.  The rest of this example is going to
use IRSA's services as an example.<P>


<a name="tapSearches.selectTable"><strong>Select Table</strong></A>: 
If you have selected IRSA's TAP service, the next choices are <em>IRSA
Tables</em>. You first need to select the "project" (called "Table
Collection" or "Schema"). Then, having selected that, the drop-down
menu on the right changes to reflect the tables available under that
schema.<P>

Then <a name="tapSearches.constraints"><strong>Enter
Constraints</strong></A>: On the <strong>left</strong>, you can impose
a variety of constraints. In addition to selecting the tickbox
indicating that you wish to impose a particular kind of constraints,
you need to specify which columns should be used for those
constraints. <a href="#moreconstraints">More information on these
constraints is above.</A>  On the <strong>right</strong> is a list of
the columns in the selected table, with tickboxes to indicate which
columns will be returned. You can also set constraints on the columns
from here, following the <a href="tables.html#filters">same filter
rules as for any tables here</A>. Above this section of the screen,
there is an indication of which columns are selected (e.g., 45 of 298
columns). You can reset the column selection via the button here as
well.<P>

Then to <strong>actually do it</strong>, click "Search."<P>


<dt><strong>Getting more out of it: Taking advantage of additional
options</strong><P>
<dd>

<DL>

<dt><strong>Regaining some space</strong>
<dd>
If you want to hide the top row after selecting a service (to
regain screen real estate), look for this on the far right:<br> <img
src="img/hidetap.png"><br> The "TAP Services:" button (show/hide) will
reveal or conceal this top row.<P>

<DT><a name="tapSearches.selectBy"><strong>Selecting a Query Type</strong></A>

<DD>Also on the far right of the top row, there is a slider that is, 
by default, set to "UI-assisted", as opposed to "Edit
ADQL". Especially when starting out, UI-assisted is easier.  By using
the UI assisted" option, you can select pre-defined options and have
the interface construct the query in ADQL. Alternatively, if you are
already fluent in ADQL, you can select the second option, "Edit ADQL",
to construct even more complex queries. <P>

After populating the search parameters using the UI, you can click the
button on the bottom, "Populate and edit ADQL" -- this takes the
parameters you have entered, creates the ADQL, and launches the "Edit
ADQL (advanced)" interface.<P>

<dt><a name="tapSearches.adql"><strong>Advanced ADQL</strong></A>
<DD>
<img src="img/voadql.png" width="75%" style="border:3px solid gray"><P>
You can get to this screen by selecting "Edit ADQL (advanced)" in step
two, or by clicking on "Populate and edit ADQL" after filling out the
UI. <P>

You can select the schema from the left side of the screen. Each of
the schemas can expand into viable tables and then columns within each
table via clicking on the "+" to the left of the folder icon. Click on
a column name to have it appear at the location of your cursor in the
ADQL query box on the right. If you have the tickbox checked on the
right that says "Insert fully-qualified column names", clicking on the
column name inserts fully-qualified column names at your cursor
location in the box. <P>

You can type the ADQL directly into the box. If you configured a
search on the "UI assisted" page, this box is already pre-filled with
the ADQL version of your search, and you can proceed to edit it
further. <P>

Examples of useful functions and queries are given on the lower
right of this window; you may need to scroll down.<P>

<strong><font color="orange">&#x26A0;</font> Tips and Troubleshooting</strong> 
<UL>
<LI>All the drop-downs near the top are roughly searchable. This is very useful
if you are trying to find a particular table or service that you can't
quite recall. Click in the drop-down area, type the first letter of
what you are looking for, and it will jump to the first instance of a
string starting with that letter. Hit that letter again, and it goes to
the second instance of a string starting with that letter.
<LI> Not every table available via this interface even has RA/Dec or,
if it does, it may not be searchable via positions. If you have
selected a table that doesn't have positions, it will not yield
results if you try to search by position. 
<LI>If none of the columns are selected, then the tool behaves as if
you have selected all of the columns.
<LI>There is a maximum number of returned rows at the bottom. If you
are anticipating more than this number of rows, increase this number!
<LI>If you arrive at the advanced ADQL page from the "Populate and
edit ADQL" button, this is a one-way trip -- any changes you make to
the ADQL here are NOT transmitted automatically back to the "UI 
Assisted" query page.
</ul><P>



If you choose to use the GUI, you can work within it to set the
constraints you desire at the bottom of the screen; see <a
href="#moreconstraints">VO TAP: More About Constraints</A> for all of
the information about setting constraints.<P>





If you select VizieR's TAP services in particular, because there are
so many tables, the tool will give you a slightly different interface
under the "Tables" section of the window. Here is the default Vizier
choices as of this writing:<br>
<img src="img/viziertap1.png" width="75%" style="border:3px solid
gray"><br>
Note that it tells you how many tables and rows are available.
Switching to tables associated with journal articles, far more tables
are available:<br>
<img src="img/viziertap2.png" width="75%" style="border:3px solid
gray"><br>
Now, if you click on the second tier menu (J/AJ/100/1091/table9), you
get a pop-up, which is another Firefly <a href="tables.html">table</A>
like any other in this tool, so it's searchable and sortable:<br>
<img src="img/viziertap3.png" width="75%" style="border:3px solid
gray"><br>
which makes it trivially easy to find tables in which you are
interested, such as those associated with papers by Massey, as
shown. Select the table that you want to search, and then continue to
specify the rest of your search, just as described above in
the <a href="#irsavotap">IRSA VO TAP Search</A> screen discussion.<P>

The result of any VO TAP search is a catalog that can be interacted
with like any other <a href="catalog.html">catalog in this
tool</A>.<P>


A special case of a TAP search is an <a href="#obscore">ObsCore
search</A>; see next section.<P>


<hr width="50%">
<h3><A name="obscore">ObsCore Search</A></h3>

An ObsCore search is technically a subcategory of a TAP search, but it
is a special subcategory in that it can return images, spectra,
catalogs, and more, or even links to services. As such, it is a wholly
different section than the <a href="#generaltap">TAP</A> section
above. <P>

There are ObsCore servers all over the world, but a good default
server to try is the CADC ObsCore service, which is what is used for
these screenshots. If any given service supports ObsCore, then an
ObsCore switch appears. Toggle that if so desired.<img
src="img/useobstap.png"><P>

The "UI Assisted"/"Edit ADQL" switch at the top right works <a
href="#tapSearches.selectBy">just like it does above</A> -- use the UI
to construct a query or dive right into the ADQL yourself. <P>

Then in the remaining part of the screen, impose the constraints you
want -- see <a href="#moreconstraints2">the constraints section
above</A>.<P>

At the bottom of the screen, you can "Populate and edit ADQL" if you
want to work with the ADQL directly, or just search straight away
after setting your search parameters. <P>

Here are results of a basically unconstrained search on M16:<br>
<img src="img/obscoreresults1.png" width="100%" style="border:3px solid
gray"><P>
The coverage image on the left shows the polygons of coverage of the
observations it found, and the plot on the right is the (relatively
uninformative) plot of the positions associated with the
observations.  The table on the bottom as a list of the observations
that it found consistent with the search parameters. This table is
like <a href="tables.html">any other table in this tool</A>, so it can
be sorted, filtered, etc. Data can be selected for download via the
tickboxes on the left. The other tab on the upper left ("Data
Product") shows a preview, when possible, of the data product
corresponding to the highlighted row in the table.   <p>




The result of any ObsCore search is a table that is a list of
observations, and that table can be interacted with like any other <a
href="table.html">table in this tool</A>. However, it is a table of
observations and/or services, so it yields much more than just a row
in a catalog; it can give you images, spectra, and more.<P>









<hr width="50%">
<h3><A name="nedcatalogs">NED Objects</A> -- Searching for NED objects</h3>

(NED= <A href="http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">NASA
Extragalactic Database <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>.)<P>

To see this tab as a choice on the top, you may need to select it from
the <a href="overview.html#drawer">side menu</A>.<P>


<img src="img/nedcat.png" width="70%" style="border:3px solid
gray"><P>

As for the other catalog searches, the tool may pre-fill the target
position with its best guess of the coordinates of the target with
which you have been working. You can use an object name in place of
coordinates. Note that although NED is used for name resolution, the
actual search is then performed using coordinates, as opposed to name.
In this case, you are limited to a cone search, so the next option is
the cone search radius. Pick your units from the drop-down first, and
then enter a number; if you enter a number and then select from the
drop-down, it will convert your number from the old units to the new
units. There are both upper and lower limits to your search radius; it
will tell you if you request something too big or too small. <P>

From the NED results, you have one-click access to the fully detailed
information from NED on any object returned from such a search.
The search results will generally include a column "Details", though
you may have to scroll to the right to see it. Clicking on a link in
this column takes you directly to the full NED information display for
the selected object in a new window.
<P>

The result of any NED search is a table that behaves like any other <a
href="table.html">table in this tool</A>.<P>



<hr width="50%">
<h3><A name="voscs">VO SCS</A> -- VO Simple Cone Search</h3>

(SCS = simple cone search.)<P>

To see this tab as a choice on the top, you may need to select it from
the <a href="overview.html#drawer">side menu</A>.<P>

<br><img src="img/vocatalogs.png" width="70%" style="border:3px solid
gray"><br>
<P>

As for the other searches, the tool may try to pre-fill the target
position with the coordinates of the target with which you have been
working. In this case, you are limited to a cone search, so the next
option is the cone search radius. As usual, pick your units from the
drop-down first, and then enter a number; if you enter a number and
then select from the drop-down, it will convert your number from the
old units to the new units. There are both upper and lower limits to
your search radius; it will tell you if you request something too big
or too small. <P>

If you know your VO URL already, you can jump down to the Cone Search
URL box and type or paste your URL into the box and hit search.<P>

More commonly, however, users do not know <em>a priori</em> which URL
to use. Click on "Find Astronomical Data Resources" to be dropped into
a VO search. Find the URL corresponding to the catalog you want, copy
it, and go back and paste it in the URL box. The URL should not have
the RA and Dec in it; the tool will add your RA and Dec as listed to
the URL in the right syntax. Click on
"Search" to initiate the search. <P>


<strong>Example</strong><p>

Load the tool. Search on IC1396. Go to the catalogs tab. Choose "VO
Catalog." It wants the root URL for a cone search. Click on "Find
Astronomical Data Resources", which goes <a

Look for the complete catalog release (not just one associated with
one specific study). The name of the catalog goes <a
href="http://vao.stsci.edu/directory/getRecord.aspx?id=ivo://CDS.VizieR/II/321"
target="_blank">here <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>. Hit
the [+] to expand it. There is one URL listed there, under "available
endpoints for the standard interface." Copy that URL and paste it into
the search form. The IRSA tool will append your coordinates and radius
and return you a table.<P>

Note that searching the VO means that you are using resources not
specifically housed at IRSA, so servers may be down, or timeouts set,
or limits on numbers of returned sources, etc., that are beyond our
control. In most cases the solution is to specify as precise a search
as possible.  The URL you enter into the box in the search panel must be a
Cone Search base URL (not containing RA and Dec parameters, which are
inserted into the URL by the tool in response to the search
parameters you give it).

<LI>The master list of registries is <a href="http://rofr.ivoa.net/"
target="_blank">here <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>. You
can also search the registries directly via that link (as opposed to
via Firefly).

The result of any VO SCS search is a catalog that can be interacted
with like any other <a href="catalog.html">catalog in this
tool</A>.<P>
